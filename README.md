This project is a Mini project to practice the skills used in the COOP Program to get hands on experience with Digital Marketing. 

Working in a group of four, the task was to analyze mock data according to deliverables given by a mock client to determine how well 
the client's campaigns were doing, which campaigns were best performers, etc. 

In order to effectively complete the task, the roles were split between four people to effectively guide the team, quality check work, 
and ensure effective performance when it came to portraying the data in a visually understandable manner.
